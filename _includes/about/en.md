<h3 style="margin-bottom:10px"> Two Children’s Debate </h3>
Liezi 〔Xianqin〕

One day, Confucius met two children who were arguing. He was curious and asked them why they were arguing.

One child said: "I think the sun is closest to us when it is just rising, and furthest away from us by noon."

And the other child hurriedly said: "It’s wrong, the sun is the furthest away from us when it is just rising, and by noon it is closer."

The first child said: "when the sun first rises, it is as big as an open umbrella. At noon, the sun is only the size of a plate. Isn’t it because the sun is near us in the morning hence it looks big and is far away from us at noon hence appearing small?"

The other child said: "It is cool when the sun comes out in the morning, and it is as hot as boiling water at noon. Could that be because in the early morning the sun is further from us so it feels much chillier, and in the afternoon the sun is closer so it feels warmer?"

Confucius wasn’t able to judge who was right and who was wrong when he heard this.

The two children smiled and said to him: "Aren’t you very knowledgeable? It turns out, there’s something you also don’t understand!"
